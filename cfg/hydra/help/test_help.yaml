  You can start the simulation and test your trained policy fully on GPU with this script!
  If `checkpoint` not specified, the script will use the latest checkpoint in the `outputs` directory.

  Compose your configuration from those groups:

  ↓↓↓↓↓ Configuration groups ↓↓↓↓↓
  $APP_CONFIG_GROUPS↑↑↑↑↑ Configuration groups ↑↑↑↑↑

  Visualize the environment and your trained policy via GUI:
  `python script/test.py checkpoint=/absolute/path/to/checkpoint headless=False`

  Run many experiments in parallel by:
  `python script/test.py -m checkpoint=/absolute/path/to/checkpoint seed=0,1,2,3 n_jobs=4`
